🛸 GroupVibes

A minimalist, real-time wellbeing PWA for close-knit groups to stay in sync.

GroupVibes is a "shared emotional pulse" app. It bridges the gap between friends by prompting them to share their current state (1–10) and the context behind it, creating a low-friction way to look out for one another.
